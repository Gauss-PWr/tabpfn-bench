    "**Author**: Bruce Bulloch\n**Source**: [WEKA Dataset Collection](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/datasets.html) - part of the agridatasets archive.

Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors.\n\nIt is important to note that eucalypt trial methods changed over time; earlier trials included mostly 15 - 30cm tall seedling grown in peat plots and the later trials have included mostly three replications of eight trees grown. This change may contribute to less significant results.\n\nExperimental data recording procedures which require noting include:\n\n- instances with no data recorded due to experimental recording procedures\n\nrequire that the absence of a species from one replicate at a site was\n\ntreated as a missing value, but if absent from two or more replicates at a\n\nsite the species was excluded from the site's analyses.\n\n- missing data for survival, vigour, insect resistance, stem form, crown form\n\nand utility especially for the data recorded at the Morea Station; this\n\ncould indicate the death of species in these areas or a lack in collection\n\nof data.\n\n### Attribute Information\n\n1.
