It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd.\n\nThe original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing\n\n3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of\n\nshape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects.\n\nMeasures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes\n\nof objects to be discriminated were used to generate a class-\n\nification rule tree by means of computer induction.\n\nThis object recognition strategy was successfully used to\n\ndiscriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses\n\nviewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.\n\nThe rule tree classification performance compared favourably\n\nto MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neigh-\n\nbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and\n\ncomputational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees\n\ngenerated by example indicated that the tree structure was\n\nheavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped\n\nsimilar object views into single decisions.\n### Description\nThe features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS\n\n(Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which\n\nextracts a combination of scale independent features utilising\n\nboth classical moments based measures such as scaled variance,\n\nskewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic\n\nmeasures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and\n\ncompactness.\n\nFour \"Corgie\" model vehicles were used for the experiment:\n\na double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.\n\nThis particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the\n\nexpectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would\n\nbe readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to\n\ndistinguish between the cars.\n\nThe images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the\n\nmodel vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees\n\nto the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse\n\nbacklit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black\n\nto minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000\n\nframestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with\n\na spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels.\n\nThese images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes,\n\nnegated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and\n\nthereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to\n\nremove \"salt and pepper\" image noise.\n\nThe vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured\n\nusing a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees\n\ncorresponded to \"head on\" and \"rear\" views respectively while 90 and\n\n270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of\n\n60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured\n\nfor each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between\n\nimages. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.\n\nA further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera\n\nat elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets\n\nalso contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains\n\nonly 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image\n\nat some orientations.\n### Attributes\nCOMPACTNESS     (average perim)**2/area\n\nCIRCULARITY     (average radius)**2/area\n\nDISTANCE CIRCULARITY    area/(av.distance from border)**2\n\nRADIUS RATIO    (max.rad-min.rad)/av.radius\n\nPR.AXIS ASPECT RATIO    (minor axis)/(major axis)\n\nMAX.LENGTH ASPECT RATIO (length perp. max length)/(max length)\n\nSCATTER RATIO   (inertia about minor axis)/(inertia about major axis)\n\nELONGATEDNESS           area/(shrink width)**2\n\nPR.AXIS RECTANGULARITY  area/(pr.axis length*pr.axis width)\n\nMAX.LENGTH RECTANGULARITY area/(max.length*length perp. to this)\n\nSCALED VARIANCE         (2nd order moment about minor axis)/area\n### Along Major Axis\nSCALED VARIANCE         (2nd order moment about major axis)/area\n### Along Minor Axis\nSCALED RADIUS OF GYRATION       (mavar+mivar)/area\n\nSKEWNESS ABOUT  (3rd order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**3\n### Major Axis\nSKEWNESS ABOUT  (3rd order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**3\n### Minor Axis\nKURTOSIS ABOUT  (4th order moment about major axis)/sigma_min**4\n### Minor Axis\nKURTOSIS ABOUT  (4th order moment about minor axis)/sigma_maj**4\n### Major Axis\nHOLLOWS RATIO   (area of hollows)/(area of bounding polygon)\n\nWhere sigma_maj**2 is the variance along the major axis and\n\nsigma_min**2 is the variance along the minor axis, and\n\narea of hollows= area of bounding poly-area of object\n\nThe area of the bounding polygon is found as a side result of\n\nthe computation to find the maximum length. Each individual\n\nlength computation yields a pair of calipers to the object\n\norientated at every 5 degrees. The object is propagated into\n\nan image containing the union of these calipers to obtain an\n\nimage of the bounding polygon.\n### Number Of Classes\n4       OPEL, SAAB, BUS, VAN\n### Number Of Examples\nTotal no. = 946\n\nNo. in each class\n\nopel 240\n\nsaab 240\n\nbus  240\n\nvan  226\n\n100 examples are being kept by Strathclyde for validation.\n\nSo StatLog partners will receive 846 examples.\n### Number Of Attributes\nNo. of atts. = 18"
