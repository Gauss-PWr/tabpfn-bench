    "# OpenML dataset: **_car_**",
    "## **Description**",
    "**Author**: Marko Bohanec, Blaz Zupan\n**Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation) - 1997\n**Please cite**: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html)\n**Car Evaluation Database**:\nThis database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\n\nThe model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:\n\nCAR                      car acceptability\n. PRICE                  overall price\n. . buying               buying price\n. . maint                price of the maintenance\n. TECH                   technical characteristics\n. . COMFORT              comfort\n. . . doors              number of doors\n. . . persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry\n. . . lug_boot           the size of luggage boot\n. . safety               estimated safety of the car\n\nInput attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for\nthese examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).\n\nThe Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.\n\n### Changes with respect to car (1)\n\nThe ordinal variables are stored as ordered factors in this version.\n\n### Relevant papers:\nM.
