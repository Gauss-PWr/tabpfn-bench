Relevant Information Paragraph:\n\nPredicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of\nabalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it,\nand counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and\ntime-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are\nused to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns\nand location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.\n\nFrom the original data examples with missing values were removed (the\nmajority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the\ncontinuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).\n\nData comes from an original (non-machine-learning) study:\n\nWarwick J Nash, Tracy L Sellers, Simon R Talbot, Andrew J Cawthorn and\nWes B Ford (1994) \"The Population Biology of Abalone (_Haliotis_\nspecies) in Tasmania.
